**Justin Daeho Kim's Interdisciplinary Major Thesis Proposal Summary:**

**Purpose:**

- To understand the practices used by local public and private school teachers to promote participation in the Fralin Museum of Art’s Writer’s Eye creative writing program.
- Concern raised due to a notably low number of submissions from Charlottesville Public School students to the Writer's Eye program.
- The study aims to provide equal opportunities for students to engage with art and address the issue of low engagement from schools near the Fralin Museum of Art.

**Key Terms:**

- The Fralin Museum of Art
- The Fralin Student Docents
- Writer’s Eye creative-writing program
- Charlottesville City School District

**Research Questions:**

1. What socioeconomic factors deter teacher engagement and student participation in the Writer’s Eye program within the Charlottesville School District?
2. How can engagement strategies be co-developed with local teachers to enhance student participation in Writer’s Eye?

**Hypotheses:**

1. Limited resources and time for Charlottesville City School teachers result in reduced participation in the Writer’s Eye program.
2. Enhancing dialogue between the Fralin and Charlottesville City Schools and involving educators in the co-creation of outreach strategies can boost participation.

**Methodology:**

- A combination of quantitative data analysis and qualitative research.
- Collection of demographic data from all nine Charlottesville City Schools, and a sample from other public and private schools.
- Surveys post-Writer’s Eye submission period and feedback surveys from teachers.
- Interviews with stakeholders like Current Student Docents, Education Staff, former students, and current teachers.
- Focus group discussions with Charlottesville City School educators.
- Data analysis will cover three main areas: Arts Administration, Data Science, and Sociology.
  
**Presentation:**

- A detailed research paper, with clear sections including statistical analysis, qualitative findings, and future suggestions.
- A condensed and designed PDF handbook detailing the research and recommendations.
- A thesis presentation & defense session.

**Ethical Concerns:**

- The research aims to influence the Writer’s Eye program's outreach strategies.
- Strict measures will be taken to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of students and teachers.
- Raw data will be securely stored and won't be shared with third parties.

**CHAT-GPT's Role:**

- To assist in modeling the relationships between variables.
- Transcriptions of questions asked to CHAT-GPT will be included in an appendix.
- Any advice from CHAT-GPT will be verified by an independent source, and even unused information will be documented in the appendix.
